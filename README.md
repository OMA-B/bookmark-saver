# bookmark-saver

This is quite some project to build my knowledge on how to:

~ make an attractive UI

~ make a good-looking modal with blurry background

~ get data from user and store

~ save to and fetch object data from browser's storage

~ manipulate the DOM to make bookmarks respectively

~ fetch favicons remotely

and so many more

Resources used:

~ Google link that fetches favicons remotely; `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=${site's url goes here}`

~ Stackoverflow

~ https://regexr.com

~ fonts from Google Fonts

~ w3Schools

~ more insights from mates (with much thanks)

~ Inspiration/Knowledge from Jacinto Designs

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
